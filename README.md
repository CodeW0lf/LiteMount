# LiteMount WoW Addon

Customizable random mount summoning, since 2011.

LiteMount supports journal mounts, Travel Form, Ghost Wolf, Running
Wild, Tarecgosa, Moonfang, Flying Broom, and other item-summoned
mounts. LiteMount excludes flying mounts in areas where you can't fly.

With LiteMount you can set rules to customize which mounts are summoned
based on location, class, spec, faction, modifier key and more.
