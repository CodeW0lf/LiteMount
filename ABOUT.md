LiteMount excludes flying mounts in areas where you can't fly.

# Other Features and Information

## Copying Target's Mount

If you have a player targeted, LiteMount will try to copy the mount they are
currently using. You can turn this awesome feature off in the settings.

## In-Combat Actions

LiteMount cannot mount in combat. It has a default set of combat actions which
can dismount you, exit vehicles, or cast Travel Form or Ghost
Wolf.

## Getting Out of Water

Jump out of the water and activate LiteMount within one second to fly, float
or run away.

## Druids and Travel/Cat Forms

Activate LiteMount while moving or jumping to cast Travel Form.

Go into the settings and set the unavailable macro to "/cast Cat Form".

## Shamans and Ghost Wolf

Activate LiteMount while moving or jumping to activate Ghost Wolf.

## Tarecosa

You will need to have Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest equipped for LiteMount to
transform you into Tarecgosa's Visage. Unfortunately WoW is unable to equip
and use an item in one action, so LiteMount can't equip it for you.

# If This AddOn Seems Abandoned

If more than two weeks go by after a major patch and LiteMount hasn't been
updated, I've probably been hit by a bus. In that case I encourage anyone with
the necessary ability to take over maintenance of the addon. It is released
under the terms of the GNU General Public License, which means anyone can take
it and do whatever they want with it, as long as they too release their code
under the same terms.
